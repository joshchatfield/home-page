<h3>Quality Assurance</h3><br>
Give me a site and I will break it, or find a flaw in it and then suggest solutions.  If you want to know if you are ready for launch
I can do that for you.

<h3><strong>User Interface Consultant</strong></h3><br>
what feeling do you want users to associate with your website?<br><br>

You are not designing things for yourself, you are designing them 
for other people, keep them in mind. The user is looking for 
information; getting it easily will give a positive relaxed 
feeling, making them use effort will lead to frustration. This 
is the feeling the user will associate with your website. Give 
the user the most amount of information with the least amount of 
effort. Placement, organization, color, and size should all convey 
specific information. Do not limit yourself to verbose wording as 
the only way to communicate. In general, items should be large with 
ample spacing. Distractions are tiring, avoid them at all costs. Only 
present one set of information at a 
time.<br><br>
In the eyes of the user beautiful is not a complicated or difficult 
task for the creator it is something done with them in mind. This is
 generally simple and to the point using all of the sensory information 
that the user will be taking in: color, size, placement, organization, 
timing (when things appear), movement, and sound.

<h3><strong>Initial Website Set-up</strong></h3><br>
The main question here is whether or not we want to create something fully customizable 
from the ground up on our own server or go with the tried and true templates of a service 
like Wordpress. The main advantage to a template site like Wordpress is that it takes 
little technical expertise to upkeep once initial set-up is complete and it will take less 
time to create something that will naturally have a well finished design.
</div>

 <div class = "box">
<h3><strong>Mobile Optimization</strong></h3><br>
How something will appear on a mobile device can be tricky, unintuitive,
and often overlooked, even by some of the biggest names in the business. 
If your competitor's site is clean, clear, and efficient on mobile and yours 
is not, customers will remember that.<br><br>

<strong>Viewport Scalability</strong><br>
first big question is whether or not to use viewport scalability. 
This means when your content is viewed on a smaller screen do you want 
everything to shrink to scale with the container, leaving the positioning 
unchanged, or do you want the content to stay the same size as the 
container shrinks and let the positioning of everything shuffle around?<br><br>

In the case of a site focused mainly on design and not bogged down with the 
responsibility of conveying a lot of information  viewport may not be ideal. 
This is because there will definitely 
be movement of items if viewport scalability is turned on, and for something that was carefully
laid out with design in mind you may not want that.

In the case of an information heavy site, viewport is almost necessary. This is because on small devices
writing that looks normal on larger screens will become illegibly small. This page
 is an example of an information heavy site. The <a href = "http:
//www.chatfieldcreate.com">ChatfieldCreate</a> homepage is an example of a
page more focused on design<br><br>

<strong>Navigation Menu</strong><br>
Next big question is how to display the navigation menu, I have found
 that using a full page for this is most suitable. This preserves the majority
of the screen for content because only a small button is necessary to give the user access
to another screen which will serve as the menu.<br><br>

<strong>Home Icon</strong><br>
Always have a button, preferably a logo/icon available to your user for them to return 
to the homepage, this should never leave their screen. Not only is this an opportunity
to reinforce your brand but it is essential for user ease. A good example is the physical home button on the iPhone, 
how lost would you feel without it?<br><br> 

<strong>Device Width</strong><br><br>
The changing width of devices is the main
 variable to keep in mind while designing, and remember that most devices 
can be turned sideways. <br><br>

<strong>Low Volume of Content</strong><br><br>
The screen is small so there should be few 
options per page at any one time. Remember that mobile browsers will auto 
show/hide menus of their own, even further reducing screen size. group things into larger categories 
if there are too many. This should be the case anyway, small screen 
or not, to give a clean sleek feeling that does not overwhelm the
 user.
