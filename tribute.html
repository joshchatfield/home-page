    Pith Teachings

<div class = "row">
    <p id = "teachings">Positive thinking is to be adopted and negative thinking is to be abandoned. Positive thinking is: renunciation, compassion, faith, love, and wisdom. Negative thinking is: anger, jealousy, greed, pride, and ignorance.<br>
    Renunciation is reducing one's own negative thinking. Compassion is reducing other's negative thinking. Faith is recognizing positive thinking as the cause of one's own happiness. Love is recognizing other's positive thinking as the cause of their happiness and wanting it to increase. Wisdom is clearly seeing reality as it is.<br>
    Anger is wanting other's to suffer. Jealousy is liking other's suffering and not liking their happiness. Greed is identifying anything besides one's own positive thinking as the cause of happiness. Pride is comparing yourself to others in any way that keeps you from improving through renouncing your negative thinking. Ignorance is not seeing reality clearly.
